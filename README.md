Hi Guys

This ReadMe fill is meant for a short overview of the current work. Please keep track off all the updates in this file.

(Mark TODOs also in the Code with "//TODO" and add description)

For Design View left click on the file (example Main.java) -> open with -> WindowBuilder Editor

#General Infos:
The config.properties file will be used later again. At the moment the login file will be saved in the project folder
with the name:
	"Username"config.properties
"Username" will be entered with the first run of the program.

#Done:
-Bare Bone off the Main Class
	-start screen Layout (no Design)
	-link to Login Screen
-Login Screen

	-Password repeating for correction of typing errors
-Implementation of the Menu bar
